6. In the context of blockchain development toolkits, what function does a component often referred to as a 'local node simulator' (like Anvil, Ganache, or Hardhat Network) typically serve?
    * It provides an isolated, high-speed local blockchain environment for development, testing, and debugging of smart contracts.
7. After installing a new command-line utility, what is a common way to verify that the installation was successful and the tool is accessible system-wide?
    * Executing the command name followed by a flag to request its version information (e.g., 'toolname --version').
