1. When editing text files within VS Code, how is the status of unsaved modifications commonly indicated?
    * A dot appears next to the filename.
2. What role does a configuration file (e..g, 'foundry.toml', 'package.json') typically play within a software development project?
    * It defines project-specific settings, dependencies, and parameters for the development tools and build process.
3. Compared to using HTTPS authentication (requiring username/password or tokens), what is a primary advantage of using SSH keys for interacting with remote Git repositories?
    * Often eliminates the need to repeatedly enter credentials for operations like pushing code after initial setup.
4. Applying consistent indentation and spacing rules throughout a codebase primarily helps to:
    * Enhance code maintainability and readability for developers.
5. Which component generated during compilation represents the actual code that is stored on the blockchain after the contract deployment process is complete?
    * Deployed Bytecode
6. When a smart contract is compiled, what standard interface specification is generated to define how applications can interact with it?
    * Application Binary Interface (ABI)
7. Compilation tools often generate output files containing contract details. Where these essential output files, such as the ABI and bytecode, stored within a project structure?
    * In a dedicated output or build artifacts directory (i.e. out folder)
8. What information does the 'bytecode' component of a compilation output primarily contain?
    * The low-level instructions executed by the blockchain's virtual machine.
